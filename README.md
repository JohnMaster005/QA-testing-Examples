# QA Testing Portfolio

Welcome to my **QA Testing Portfolio**! This repository is a collection of projects and examples that showcase my journey and skills in software testing. As I transition into a more technical role in Quality Assurance (QA), I am continuously expanding my knowledge and applying my learning to various real-world testing scenarios.

## Professional Experience

I have worked at **Bromio**, collaborating closely with the **porting team** to ensure high-quality game releases. My responsibilities included:

- **Test Case Creation** – Developed structured test cases covering various gameplay scenarios.
- **Bug Reporting** – Identified, documented, and tracked issues to ensure proper fixes.
- **Collaboration** – Worked alongside developers to verify bug resolutions and optimize QA workflows.

During my time at Bromio, I contributed to the QA process for games such as **Shovel Knight Dig**, **Robobeat**, **No Umbrellas Allowed**, among others. This experience strengthened my ability to analyze, document, and report software issues effectively.

## Why This Repository?

I created this repository to document and demonstrate my understanding of software testing principles and practices. The projects here represent my work as I develop expertise in:

- **Manual Testing** – Test case creation, bug reporting, and exploratory testing.
- **QA Methodologies** – Understanding and applying best practices in software testing.

## What’s Included?

This repository includes a variety of QA-related examples that I’ve worked on or am currently exploring:

### 1. Manual Testing Examples
- **Test Case Creation**  
  I have written test cases for various gameplay scenarios. These test cases cover features such as gameplay mechanics, user inputs, and more.
  
- **Bug Reporting**  
  I’ve documented the issues found during my testing process, reporting them with severity levels, steps to reproduce, and recommendations for resolution.

### 2. QA Methodologies and Techniques
- **Agile Testing** – Learning about Agile methodologies and their impact on QA, including how to create test cases during development and collaborate in sprint cycles.
- **Test Strategy Development** – Exploring the creation of test plans and strategies that align with project goals.
